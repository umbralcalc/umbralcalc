**Hello there!** :wave:

* I'm a professional research engineer and simulation builder with experience in many problem domains.
* My expertise is in Bayesian statistics, machine learning methods and all things stochastic.
* My domain knowledge includes statistics, physics (cosmology), epidemiology, sports betting and traffic control.
* In my free time I develop code and write in this technical article repository: [https://umbralcalc.github.io/](https://umbralcalc.github.io/).
* I also like to [create some human art](https://umbralcalc.github.io/human-art/) üñåÔ∏è every now and then.
