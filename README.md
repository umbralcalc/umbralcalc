**Hello there!** :wave:

I am an expert in engineering intelligent decision-making technologies with Python/Go/Rust simulations.

Decision-making technologies I have worked on include:
* Building a generalised platform for a wide variety of business decision-making problems.
* Optimising traffic light control behaviour to improve the flow of multi-modal traffic.
* Improving betting decisions based on simulated cricket match predictions.
* Recommending mass drug administration policies that maximise the opportunity for disease elimination.
* Optimising cosmological survey decisions to increase the chance of detecting physics models.
    
In my free time I develop code and [write technical docs](https://umbralcalc.github.io/stochadex).

I also like to create [games for python programmers](https://umbralcalc.github.io/dexetera/) and pencil/pastel/ink artwork.
