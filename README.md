**Hello there!** :wave: 

* I'm a professional software research engineer and simulation builder with experience in many problem domains.
* I've got an overall interest and expertise in all things stochastic and statistical.
* My domain knowledge includes statistics, physics (cosmology), epidemiology, sports betting and traffic control.
* I also like to [create some human art](https://umbralcalc.github.io/human-art/) üñåÔ∏è every now and then.

**What am I doing on GitHub at the moment?**

:black_nib: I'm writing [an open source book](https://github.com/umbralcalc/worlds-of-observation) about creating more realistic environments for training machine learning systems. You can download the latest version for free [from this website](https://umbralcalc.github.io/worlds-of-observation/).

**Here are some of my past projects:**

:nerd_face: A collection of [22 published research papers](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8778-006X) in cosmology, epidemiology and statistical science.

:fireworks: A multi-dimensional Langevin solver which can be used to compute [the IR dynamics of quantum fields in the early Universe](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2018/05/054). You can read the tutorial [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/umbralcalc/nfield/blob/master/notebooks/example_run.ipynb).

:telescope: A new Bayesian design and information theory-based toolkit that is useful for [designing optimal scientific experiments with a range of utilities](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2018/05/070). You can read the tutorial [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/umbralcalc/foxi/blob/master/foxiscripts/5D_example.ipynb).

:petri_dish: A simulation and inference framework for [forecasting the effect of mass drug administration on helminth disease transmission](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436521000013). Much of the inference theory is covered by this [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/umbralcalc/helmpy/blob/master/notebooks/helmpy_inference.ipynb). You can also read the simulation tutorial [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/umbralcalc/helmpy/blob/master/notebooks/helmpy_examples.ipynb).

:mask: A very simple [COVID-19 simulation where the basic theory is extended to account for heterogeneous transmission events](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/umbralcalc/covid-simple/blob/master/covid-simple.ipynb). You can find out more on the theory and inference of these models [here](https://royalsociety.org/news/2020/09/set-c-covid-r-rate/).

:test_tube: A framework for the [simulation and fast inference of multi-state models with a counting memory](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/umbralcalc/pneumoinfer/blob/master/notebooks/theory-docs.ipynb). This is applied to the pneumococcal carriage process using this [model](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/335/6074/1376.long).

:chart: A toolkit for building some [simple Bayesian networks to model generic n-dimensional time series data](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/umbralcalc/bants/blob/master/notes/theory-notes.ipynb). This comes with some example [implementation notebooks](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/umbralcalc/bants/blob/master/example/example_ARGP_bants_application.ipynb) which apply the networks to mock data. 

:money_with_wings: An agent-based [microsimulation of limit order books for financial markets](https://nbviewer.org/github/umbralcalc/lobsim/blob/main/LOB_simulation.ipynb) inspired by extensions to the Santa Fe model. This simulation could potentially be adapted in future to model data from real books.

:zap: A fully generalised, highly configurable, [stochastic simulation framework](https://github.com/umbralcalc/stochadex) written with a concurrent backend architecture and a frontend dashboard for visualisation.

:computer: A concurrent, generalised, [online learning and MAP inference framework](https://github.com/umbralcalc/learnadex) which accompanies a RESTful API to query the results from. There's also a dashboard app for viewing API queries.
