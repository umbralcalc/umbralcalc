**Hello there!** :wave: 

I'm a multidisciplinary simulation builder and data scientist with expertise in stochastic phenomena and Bayesian methodology.

**Here are the other profiles that I maintain:**

**Here are some of my projects, both past and present:**

:nerd_face: During my academic research years, I had the opportunity to write/co-write a collection of [22 published research papers in cosmology, epidemiology and statistical science](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8778-006X).

:fireworks: As part of my PhD studies, I wrote a multi-dimensional Langevin solver for [the IR dynamics of quantum fields in the early Universe](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2018/05/054). You can read the tutorial [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/umbralcalc/nfield/blob/master/notebooks/example_run.ipynb).

:telescope: Also during this time, I built a new Bayesian toolkit for [designing optimal scientific experiments with a range of utilities](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2018/05/070). You can read the tutorial [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/umbralcalc/foxi/blob/master/foxiscripts/5D_example.ipynb).

:petri_dish: Moving on to post-doctoral research, I then designed a simulation and inference framework for [forecasting the effect of mass drug administration on helminth disease transmission](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436521000013). Much of the inference theory is covered by this [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/umbralcalc/helmpy/blob/master/notebooks/helmpy_inference.ipynb). You can also read the simulation tutorial [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/umbralcalc/helmpy/blob/master/notebooks/helmpy_examples.ipynb).

:mask: At the onset of the pandemic, I wrote a very simple [COVID-19 simulation where the basic theory is extended to account for heterogeneous transmission events](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/umbralcalc/covid-simple/blob/master/covid-simple.ipynb). You can find out more on the theory and inference of these models [here](https://royalsociety.org/news/2020/09/set-c-covid-r-rate/).

:test_tube: Moving on from academic reseach to pursuing projects in my free time, I then wrote a framework for the [simulation and fast inference of multi-state models with a counting memory](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/umbralcalc/pneumoinfer/blob/master/notebooks/theory-docs.ipynb). This is applied to the pneumococcal carriage process using this [model](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/335/6074/1376.long).

:chart: Interested in designing some more general inference tools for future use, I created a toolkit for building some [simple Bayesian networks to model generic n-dimensional time series data](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/umbralcalc/bants/blob/master/notes/theory-notes.ipynb). This comes with some example [implementation notebooks](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/umbralcalc/bants/blob/master/example/example_ARGP_bants_application.ipynb) which apply the networks to mock data. 

:money_with_wings: Interested in some of the more detailed modelling approaches to financial market behaviour, I then built an agent-based [microsimulation of limit order books for financial markets](https://nbviewer.org/github/umbralcalc/lobsim/blob/main/LOB_simulation.ipynb) inspired by extensions to the Santa Fe model. This simulation could potentially be adapted in future to model data from real books.

:black_nib: Now in my free time, I'm co-authoring [an open source book](https://github.com/umbralcalc/diffusing-ideas) which documents an ongoing software development project to create generalised simulation, inference, manipulation and control optimisation tools for stochastic phenomena. It's aimed particularly at mathematically-inclined programmers and computational scientists and you can download the latest version for free [here](https://github.com/umbralcalc/diffusing-ideas/raw/main/book.pdf).
